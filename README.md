# Optimization-of-Training-and-Relighting-complexity-of-NeuralRTI

Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is a computational photography technique used to capture and analyze the surface texture and topology of objects. By taking multiple pictures from a fixed perspective while changing the light directions, RTI allows users to dynamically relight surfaces, providing an interactive way to explore and study complex surface details. 
 
NeuralRTI is a neural network-based RTI framework designed to encode data at the pixel level, enhancing the effectiveness and quality of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI). It is trained on a Multi-Light Image Collection (MLIC) pixel dataset, derived from images captured under multiple light directions. As both the image dimensions and the number of light directions increase, so do the memory and training time. This method constructs a latent pixel representation for interactive relighting, with the decoder and network coefficients trained end-to-end from the original pixel data. However, this process becomes more complex with larger images. 

To address the training complexity challenges, this project employs three key optimization strategies: downsampling (which involves downscaling, random sampling, and patch-based strategies), minimizing decoder configurations, and integrating surface normals data. Downscaling reduces the image resolution(320x320 -> 160x160 and 80x80), thus decreasing the computational load while maintaining essential surface details. Random sampling retains a certain percentage of pixels(10,20,30,40,50%) from the original data to minimize redundancy, while patch-based sampling divides the image into smaller, uniform patches, enabling more efficient processing. The reduction of the decoder configuration(fulland half-unit of the layers) aims to optimize the architecture to achieve a balance between efficiency and performance.Integrating surface normals, which represent the orientation of the surface at each pixel, significantly enhance the detail and accuracy of image reconstructions. 

Additionally,surface normals information, estimated using photometric stereo methods,was incorporated to enhance relighting precision. This provides crucial insights into the orientation of the surface at every pixel, leading to more detailed and accurate image reconstructions. The impact of integrating surface normals on training will be evaluated.
 
 Finally, the results of these optimization strategies are presented, demonstrating the most effective combination of techniques that reduce computational costs and enhance the feasibility of NeuralRTI.
