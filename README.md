# Optimization-of-Training-and-Relighting-complexity-of-NeuralRTI
NeuralRTI uses neural networks to improve Reflectance Transformation Imaging by encoding pixel-level data for interactive relighting. This work optimizes training via patch-based sampling to reduce complexity, balancing efficiency and detail, while integrating surface normals to enhance reconstruction accuracy.
